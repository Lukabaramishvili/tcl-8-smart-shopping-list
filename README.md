# Overview

The goal of this project was to collaborate with 3 developers to build a “smart” shopping list app that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you’re likely to need to buy on your next trip to the store.

As a user, you can create a shopping list and enter items (e.g., “Avocado” or “Apple”) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.

The app will work in many of the same ways as [iNeedToBuy.xyz](https://app.ineedtobuy.xyz/) (on which our project is based) with the exception that we will not be implementing barcode scanning (that feature would add a lot of scope to the project and wasn’t all that useful).
